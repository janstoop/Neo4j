Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install Required Packages:
First, make sure you have the neo4j package installed. You can install it using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install neo4j
Connect to Neo4j:
You'll need to connect to your Neo4j database using the connection credentials (URI, username, and password). Update these values according to your Neo4j configuration:

python
Copy code
from neo4j import GraphDatabase

uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"  # Replace with your Neo4j URI
username = "neo4j"              # Replace with your Neo4j username
password = "yourpassword"       # Replace with your Neo4j password

driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=(username, password))
Define Cypher Queries:
Define the Cypher queries to create nodes and relationships based on your data model. For each CSV file, you'll need a separate query to create nodes and relationships.

python
Copy code
create_education_query = """
// Define your Cypher query to create nodes and relationships for education data
"""

create_transaction_query = """
// Define your Cypher query to create nodes and relationships for transaction data
"""

create_trips_query = """
// Define your Cypher query to create nodes and relationships for trips data
"""

create_work_query = """
// Define your Cypher query to create nodes and relationships for work data
"""
Ingest Data:
Open and read each CSV file, parse the data, and execute the corresponding Cypher queries to create nodes and relationships in the Neo4j database.

python
Copy code
with driver.session() as session:
    with open('sng_education.csv') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Parse CSV data and execute create_education_query

    with open('sng_transaction.csv') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Parse CSV data and execute create_transaction_query

    with open('sng_trips.csv') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Parse CSV data and execute create_trips_query

    with open('sng_work.csv') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Parse CSV data and execute create_work_query
Run the Application:
Run your Python script to execute the Cypher queries and ingest the data into the Neo4j database.
